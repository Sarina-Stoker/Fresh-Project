    <h2> Questions &amp; Answers </h2>
    <h4>How old are you?</h4>
      <p>I am 20 years young.</p>
    <h4> What is your birthday? </h4>
      <p> October 15, 1995 </p>
    <h4> Where were you born and where did you grow up? </h4>
      <p> I was born and raised on the south side of Chicago. </p>
     <h4> Describe your life growing up. </h4>
      <p> Overall, I have a small family. But in my immediate family, I have 4 siblings, one of which includes my twin brother! We were raised by a single mother in a small home. We 
          didn't have a whole lot of money so we couldn't go to a private school or have iphones, I didn't get a car for any of my birthdays or graduation or have the nicest clothes 
          or shoes, but we had what we needed. We didn't go to swimming lessons, piano or dance class. We entertained ourselves playing, I basically lived outside as a kid(as in we played
          outside everyday after school until 10 or 11pm and pretty much all day on weekends). That was our "extra-curricular" activities. I went to public school. I started working as soon 
          as I was legally able to have a real job which was 16 and I've been working ever since. I am currently handling all my school finances on my own.</p>
    <h4> What was your favorite subject in school? </h4>
      <p> I don't think I have a favorite subject, but my favorite class in highscool was music. </p>
    <h4> What made you choose IIT? </h4>
      <p> I chose IIT because they gave me a great scholarship and also I knew it was a good school to graduate from with a STEM degree. </p>
    <h4> Why did you choose to study Information Technology Management? </h4>
      <p> Well I started out as a computer science major, but I switched to ITM halfway through college. What led me to want to pursue a career in the CS or IT field
          was because ever since middle school, the class I enjoyed the most was computers. It was pretty much the only class I looked forward to during the day.
          I didn't have strong fondness towards math or science or english, but I always liked computer class so when it was time to pick my major for college, I knew 
          I wanted to do something in the field of technology. I started out with CS, but I switched to ITM because the broadness of what I could do with an ITM degree 
          appealed to me more. Also I'm also having a bit of fun in my classes.</p>
